    <h3>More Info...</h3>
	<p>Being situated in the US, international purchases may be subject to a <a href="https://support.pirateship.com/en/articles/3859826-list-of-countries-not-currently-accepting-shipments-from-usps-or-ups" target="_blank">list of countries</a> our postal service is restricted to send to. Refunds are issued accordingly.</p>
    <p>Shipment will take 1-3 days after placed order.</p>
	<p>All stuff is home-manufactured and secured in salvaged packaging (recyclable plastic, envelopes, and absorbants). Our model focuses on self-sustainability and minimal third party support, and I encourage my backers and fellow creatives to follow suit.</p>
