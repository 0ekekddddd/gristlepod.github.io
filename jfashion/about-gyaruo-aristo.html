	  <h4>What is Gyaruo Fashion &amp; Aristocrat?</h4>
	  <div>
	    <p>Gyaruo and Aristocrat are terms describing <b>period-specific</b> subcultures in Japan. Modernly, they're used by fashion youth to describe two distinct looks of what these scenes wore throughout their daily lives.</p>
		<p>They're two incredibly distinct looks on a surface level and even seemingly opposite, but have some overlap depending on the local scene and are known to mashup. It was not just the "clothing style" that unified those who looked this way, but also the way they spent their time together. These youths were inherently counter-cultural to conservative modern Japan.</p>
	  </div>
	  <h4>Why These Two?</h4>
	  <div>
	    <p>I started out in oldschool EGL communities. Over the years I slowly relaxed into the grittier look of "visual gyaruo." Even though aristocrat and gyaruo seem like opposites, they're both mature, sleek styles founded in designer brands and luxury fabric&mdash; What aristocrat lacks in color it makes up for rich velvets and laces. Gyaruos wore a lot of designer labels to express that specific look of a wealthy rockstar. These are definitely my style of fashion.</p>
		<p></p>
	  </div>
	  <h4>What is Gyaruo?</h4>
	  <div>
	    <p>Gyaruo is short for ギャル男 or "GAL man". It's not to be confused for a "male version" of gal, but a co-existing subgroup of gyaru culture. Similarly, gyaru is ギャル, loaned from the english word "gal."</p>
		<p>A gyaru doesn't exist because of what she wears, but because of what she's willing to wear in her own interest despite what Japanese beauty standards tells her to wear. When Japanese beauty standards tells her she can't tan or wear eye-consuming lashes, she wears them anyway. If she doesn't want to, she doesn't. (Though you can't be gyaru without makeup!)</p>
		<p>Alternatively, gyaruo exist for a different reason but coexist amongst gyaru circles. Gyaruos were predominantly men who wanted to emulate a range of American rock styles with that Japanese flair; as opposed to boxy and baggy, gyaruo coordinates were structurally skintight and sexy. Scene-wise, both gyarus and gyaruos were clubbing or enjoying their youth in some way (and probably still do) but most importantly they were like-minded and naturally formed personal circles.</p>
		<p>You're probably not going to find an original gyaruo because the original community and scene no longer exists as it did before. Nowadays the term's utility updated to a label for those inspired by the historical phenomenon that was <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisei_period">Heisei</a> Gyaru. In a way, this accessible term (and I say this neutrally) obscures the historical context of Gyaru culture and has invented a type of new derivative fashion across the world. A contemporary Japanese gyaru may differ from an original gyaru, may differ from a Chinese gyaru, may differ from an American gyaru. Not to mention the substyles. In the end the only thing that makes a true gyaru is their appreciation for gyaru history and fashion, and a participation in its occurring scenes that descended from the first.</p>

	  <h4>What is Aristocrat?</h4>
	  <div>
	    <p>Aristocrat is a broadly-encompassing style of antique goth fashion with a Japanese solution. 90's Japanese styling is important to what makes J-Aristocrat's flair work, because it does not look the same under a Western style context of antique gothic. This honestly applies to gyaru fashion as well. Gyaru styling will have different elements from its own source of inspiration in Western-coastal clotes due to its Japanese recontextualizing.</p>
	    <p></p>
	    <p>Aristocrat is <b>not</b> gothic lolita fashion, gothic ouji, or some umbrella of the two... but has overlapping elements. It's particularly known for its equally frilly, high-quality construction and textures. The only thing separating it from gothic ouji or lolita is its slender, longer silhouette.</p>
	  </div>
	  <h4>How Can I Get Into Gyaruo/Aristocrat?</h4>
	  <div>
		<p>It might be a controversial opinion, but it's not really possible to dilute either of these terms to singular accessories like you can with contemporary fashion genres and their clothing articles. When you emulate these styles, every piece must correlate with each other and read into their respective styles as whole. Because of this meticulous styling technique, most J-fashion communities identify each other by addressing their outfits as "coordinates".</p>
		<p>You either get it or you don't!</p>
		<p>That being said, don't be afraid to buy from gyaruo/aristocrat brands and creating your own style. I often wear my AATP crown necklace with Amekaji. Part of fashion enthusiasm is supporting the artists and designers who create your clothes.</p>
