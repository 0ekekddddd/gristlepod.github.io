	  <h4>&rarr; The SNS Model Is Failing: Why You Should Make A Website</h4>
	  <p>We all knew the online experience is becoming user-unfriendly by the day, we signed up knowing about all the spam to hassle with as part of a package deal with our online lives.</p>
	  <p>Every mountain landscape used to mean something about the person posting it; the journey it took to get to that location, the struggle with lighting and time arrangement, and the person's choice of the landscape. Until it didn't. Now the landscape that once took human work to capture can be retold in the words of a machine that's never been there. The machine tries to provoke the same feelings it takes to look at the scene, but it falls flat when even the person who fed it the prompt can't describe it in ways outside of superficial details. Now computers and the service-holders who enable the sloppage choose our experiences for us.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Instagram culls new profiles by removing the "recent posts" tag filters and replacing it with "top recent posts".</li>
		<li>Twitter's enshittification was so bad that its reputation along with <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitters-revenue-collapses-84-tesla-171535190.html?guccounter=1" target="_blank">its revenue got topped and dropped by and under Elon Musk's reign</a>. Ragebait is particularly a profitable meta on Twitter and in result, any sort of relevant feed to you gets lost in history and AI generative images by collateral.</li>
		<li>Even Google has become hard to navigate; you can't even look up an image of a video game character without coming across disfigured generative slop of their former selves.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>We are experiencing a unique form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">platform decay</a> as a generation who's seen both the Wild West of the internet and a blooming forever-period of the unregulated Capital Web. Eventually, our online successors won't even care for preservation, forever dooming online users in a position of consuming until the net overconsumes itself into an interbred feed of things we've already seen before. What's happening? Where do we go from here?</p>
	  <h4>&rarr; From A Designer's Perspective</h4>
	  <p>Listen, I'm not immune to the centralized web cycle. I've held several online profiles in the past: I create a portfolio account for my art, realize the old art didn't represent the present things I cared about, then make a new account for my new interests. Rinse and repeat.</p>
	  <p>I've been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website" target="_blank">webmastering</a> for a good chunk of 6 years originally because I thought it was a good transferrable skill to have as an artist. I still update my website and polish my css-fu because ultimately I can control every part of the presentation my stuff sits in for everyone (the readers, the viewers) to see. When I first dipped my toes into web development, I distinctly felt like I actually held a part of the space I've picked and played with. I've been proven with the technical viscera of brackets and code of my quaint static website that I finally owned something that wasn't written in the lustful image of online monopolies. These social media services don't give you that control. In fact it's not user-unfriendly, it's designed to be user-hostile.</p>
	  <p>All major social media platforms structure the basic user profile once described by web archivist Kyle Drake as a "Stasi apartment building". After all the rave and FOMO you've endured hearing about this spanking brand-new platform your peers are using, you eventually sign up and they give you a customizable icon, a customizable banner, and a customizable microbiography and push you to the sandbox. And you figure that's all you really need to express yourself. I don't really hate the less-is-more model because as a creator you'd want to place your content where the reader can find it with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility" target="_blank">little resistance as possible</a>; why complicate the walk between the eye to the visual? My contention lies at how blank a page can be until we truly have control.</p>
	  <p>Where I'm getting at is you don't necessarily have to scrap personality to have a sleek and accessible page. Visual design plays a great deal at speaking the unspoken in ways that text can't. Someone who dresses up in interesting silhouettes and styles their hair probably has a better understanding of their own expression than someone who carries out their day in what they slept in. These simple block profiles are usually created the way they are to easily moderate on the serverside of things, but the floor and ceiling to how much you can really tap into your digital expression is stagnantly where it was when you first make the account. Even if you wanted to offset the formula a little and make your page a sweet <normal style="background:#8fb30c;">#8fb30c</normal>, chances are there's not an option to change your profile's palette. The most you can do is toggle a "light mode" and "dark mode" to better see your daily  serving of ragebait. The user focus has now shifted onto the service's brand rather than the kernel. Until all the humanity that made the platform thrive is milked its every cent. Ever since platform services became profitable, the online experience was pretty much poisoned from the start.</p>
	  <h4>&rarr; Reframing Internet Usage</h4>
	  <p>It's unrealistic to expect everyone to fully disconnect from social media as a whole. A lot of real life elements now rely on the World Wide Web in ways that forces the internet to mirror our real identities; our jobs, our schools, our local communities. Freelancers especially need the cancerous-spread nature of Tw*tter to get any reach. Unlike some of my more passionate friends of "The Old Web," the last thing I'd want to do is antagonize those who are simply playing The Game as they've been introduced to it as.</p>
	  <p>Ideally "The Internet" is a navigation instrument. It's directionless, because it was never a place to begin with and "The World Wide Web" is complete nonsense. You instead bookmark a scattered array of websites that don't need to compete in a monopoly for The One Hub, with a focus on independent pages developed by those page's users (or at least pages with some frontend host management...)</p>
	  <p>Larger scale hosts dull a user's ability to really understand or use online resources sort of like how animals in captivity never learn to hunt. Fortunately you aren't a captive animal, and everyone still has the chance to learn about the machines they use to truly make something designed around themselves. To understand the point of the internet is also a journey of self improvement.</p>
	  <p>Imagine the internet as a Little Free Library. What do you give to the internet, and what do you take? Even if you don't have anything to share, that is okay too. Websites are hard work. Ultimately I encourage those reading to find healthier, more ethical modes of using the internet such as "de-evolving" to RSS subscriptions and using forum sites. Utilize the prehistoric and robust E-Mail. Support your local webmaster.</p>
	  <h4>&rarr; Getting Started With Decentralizing</h4>
	  <h3>Webhosting</h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>: Solid free host for static websites. What sets it apart from Neocities is git control.</li>
	    <li><a href="https://neocities.org" target="_blank">Neocities</a>: Free webhosting service. Updates using the online editor. An okay gateway for those coming from SNS wanting to learn how to code HTML/CSS through the small community that comes with it.</li>
		<li><a href="https://neocities.org" target="_blank">NekoWeb</a>: I never used it but it seems like a fork of Neocities with emphasis on in-community decoration.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h3>Design Guides</h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="http://www.r-5.org/files/books/computers/interface/design/Susan_Weinschenk-100_Things_About_People-EN.pdf" target="_blank">100 Things Every Designer Needs To Know About People</a>: This book goes into the psychology of your average reader. Good for those trying to create easy-to-read UI, bad for those who are fascinated with The Old Web aesthetic. In the latter case, ignore it.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h3>Finding Community</h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a>: Unironically Reddit is an okay forum site and is massively used because of its modern UI. You can curate your front page better than any other network of its size.</li>
		<li><a href="https://newgrounds.com" target="_blank">Newgrounds</a>: Aside its spotty legacy, Newgrounds has always stuck to its "everything by everyone," and artists/composers/programmers have the equal opportunity to feature on the front page whether you're a new user or a regular.<br><center><img src="buttons/newgrounds.gif" alt="Newgrounds.com" title="Newgrounds.com"></center></li>
		<li><a href="https://brisray.com/web/webring-list.htm" target="_blank">Webring List</a>: Alternatively web rings are a group of websites centered around one theme and while its kind of primitive with several caveats, its the best way to find niche sites in ways you can't with a search engine.</li>
