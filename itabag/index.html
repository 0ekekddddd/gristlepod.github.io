  <h1>痛バ itabag tour</h1>
  <p>I generally distance myself from where any sort of camaraderie festers and used to keep a lowkey profile during my Deviantart days, so seldom did I use forums, comments sections, or even send out any direct notes to my mutuals. In a way, I deprived myself from a lot of the culture that grew along with my online generation, and deprived myself from fandom&mdash; connection. I'm still kind of like that, except now what little digital receipt I have to my name is contained in Identity V's most active spaces. Nothing I'm ashamed to hide, I guess I just refused myself the indulgence that I deserved. Of course, I decided to change that.</p>
  <p>Despite my deprivation, I was always a fan (of something.) In 2016 I was into Danganronpa up to SDR2, and if given the disposable income and resources, Hajime Hinata was my Luchino-before-Luchino and would have been my first pick for an itabag. He hasn't entirely left my heart and he still bears plenty sentimental value, but I honestly can't approach Danganronpa the same way after replaying the games with a fresh, adult lens given post-SDR2's questionable creative decisions... I'm kind of embarrassed at the thought of wearing around Danganronpa now that I don't take it as a franchise seriously anymore. Who knows, maybe I'll put a Hinata pouch on the backburner.</p>
  <p>I never thought I'd find that spark again&mdash; not until 2024 when I rekindled my interest for Identity V.</p>
  <p>I began playing during the very new year of 2019, when I was too young to have any money to roll the gacha and the survivor kits were a lot simpler in UI and concept. It's also seriously a scary game to play when you first try it! I didn't even know the plot outside of the outlining "manor games" because despite being relatively simpler from now, you still had red icons buzzing at all cylinders of the screen and most character lore hid behind several menus. I ended up falling out with the friend group I played with and didn't pick the game back up until the Danganronpa crossovers anchored me down with <a href="https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Kokichi_Oma" target="_blank">cosmetics</a> that made me go "Well, I might as well use the skin as much as I can." Suddenly, I was investing in IDV again just enough to learn about Luchino &amp; Norton. </p>
