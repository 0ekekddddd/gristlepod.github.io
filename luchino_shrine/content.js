    document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = "<h4>&rarr; Who is Luchino?</h4><div><p>Luchino Diruse is a playable character from a Dead-By-Daylight style game called Identity V. He was introduced in Season 6 of the game's running time and just like how DBD is split into killer/survivor sides, Luchino has two playstyles in both IDV's hunter and survivor factions.</p><p>Luchino's fate is what happens when science guides itself into the fog without ethic. He worked as a herpetologist alongside a university prior to his arrival to <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Oletus_Manor' target='_blank'>Oletus</a> and is recognized in group 6, denoted by his <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Letters' target='_blank'>third character letter</a>'s confirmed serial &quot;6-1-4&quot;. He was known to test reptile bites on himself as his field was venom logic and would experience his very own genetic metamorphosis when given captivity of an unknown lizard-snake species. Some might say this was doomed kismet, but Luchino himself would go on to describe this transformation as a gift, or the &quot;presents from his research&quot;.</p></div><br><h4>&rarr; His Personality</h4><div class='rightbox'><p>He is described by <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Novelist' target='_blank'>the writer of the Character Letters</a> to be &quot;curious, cautious, envious&quot; and implied his first game has rendered him &quot;melancholic.&quot; Luchino is intuitive and tends to bear in mind other people's intentions, but composes himself politely when he speaks and isn't opposed to working with suspicious people when it meant furthering his studies. While he can be blunt, precise, and practical-minded, he is humble and realistic, understanding the limit of his abilties.</p><p>Luchino seems to embrace the final stages of his transformation. His <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Curiosity_(Emote)' target='_blank'>Character Day emote</a> tributes to his past how he remembers working as an academic professor, literally laughing at his naiveté and others who are like his younger self. This emote also sort of reflects his dark humor. In his last Character Day letter, he expresses enlightment that he no longer cares to persevere in the name of his research. It's not that he doesn't care anymore, but accepts that not everything can be understood by a mere man, and takes conclusion to his research in one last diary at the manor. He begins pursuit of his spirituality as he realizes the (Lovecraftian) nonreality of Oletus.</p><center class='quote'>&quot;And I finally understand that those researchers who regret failing to find the answer are laughable. After all, there was never a true 'answer' in this world.&quot;<br>- IDV's &quot;The Last Page of a Record&quot; (2023)</center><p>His settling mutation has rendered him something self-pleasuring and aggressive towards other people. His humor and sadistic tendencies carry into his (non-canon) online interactions and event dialogues, as he expresses an interest in plant toxins, chasing prey (sort of like a dog...) and unethical experimentation. He is long separated from the professor he once was, but he seems happier than when he was human.</p></div><br><div><table id='menu'><tr><td style='width:50%;'><center class='quote'>くく…まだそれを…ははは！<br>問うな…人間風情が…<br>私は究極…究極だ…くひひ…<br>お前を喰らいて…究極と化す…<br>その血肉を…きひひゃひゃ！<br>極限の未知の先に辿り着いた、私を、<br>満たす…満たす…満た…………<br>クギ……カ………ひひひ……<br>なぁ…もう良いだろう？<br>▽┰▽＜渇いて…仕方ないんだ…</center></td><td><center class='quote'>Hehe... still that... hahaha!<br>Don't ask... humanity is...<br>I am the ultimate... the ultimate... heehee...<br>I will devour you... and become the ultimate...<br>That flesh and blood... kihihyahya!<br>I have reached the limit of the unknown.<br>Fill... fill... fill... fill.........<br>Nail.... click.... heeheehee...<br>Hey... isn't that enough now?<br>▽┰▽＜ I'm thirsty...

    document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = "<h4>&rarr; Detailing Luchino's Mutations</h4><div><p>Not to the fault of most IDV fans since it's a common misconception, but Luchino's mutations are not representative of evolution even if he says it is. Maybe in the context of Pokémon it would be, but evolution is nothing but the natural offset of generational traits rather than a person-by-person reaction, and no amount of external stimuli or transformative venom juice will make what Luchino went through evolution. Even in context of evolution, evolution never looks back.</p><center class='quote'>[Retrieving quote, come back later. I just don't want to buy the book].</center><p>As much as I like the Ouroboros motifs of Luchino's tale, I like to think that because evolution has no memory or foresight Luchino is essentially a separate classification beyond human or reptile. He does have countless similarities of a reptile &mdash; the extra jawbone in his mouth and the scaled composition of his skin most notably &mdash; but he's probably more closely related to the biped avemetatarsalia (or something close). A parallel creature outside of the more relevant, modern, reptile. A &quot;negative dinosaur&quot;. And I use &quot;related&quot; loosely.</p></div><br><h4>&rarr; Foresight</h4><div><p>Although the contexts of evolution don't correctly describe Luchino's metamorphosis, Luchino technically <i>has</i> made it to &quot;the next step&quot; in a series of undiscovered evolutionary staircases and his anecdote is simply a peek into general reptilian genetic potential. We don't even know much about the origins of the lizard-snake thing Luchino had been studying to even classify it as either or, so as far as I'm concerned it's &quot;like&quot; a reptile, but has zero ties to any Earthly reptile.</p><p>One of my favorite anatomical features about Luchino is definitely his digitigrade hindlegs. When I first saw them in-game, I just sort of found them offputting. Offputting, but attractive, as they established a kind of disconnect from true reptile anatomy and I chalked it off as an oversight by Netease. Most modern reptiles are plantigrade like bears and humans, but his legs are bird-like where he has a third segment of leg that he stands on rather than his whole sole touching the floor.</p><p>I probably would've accepted either approach because some of the best fantastical designs stray away from anatomical accuracy and just work because they look cool. <b>However.</b> To my thrill, his deduction quests and Character Day letters intentionally make the origins of the his reptile specimen obscure, describing it as both a snake and a lizard in multiple instances. It's actually a great testament of Luchino's themes of ambiguity.</p></div><br><center><a href='#' onclick='selectLink(`ambiguityThemes`)'><img src='images/hunt_luchino_40x40.gif' alt='Click me to proceed'></a></center>";

    document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = "<h4>&rarr; Themes of Ambiguity: Alternate Identity System</h4><div><p>To the Identity V players who haven't picked up the game since the last Case Closed Crossover, the game had a 2.0 update and room for a replacement protagonist was made, Alice Deross (The Journalist). Following her debut the game introduced the idea of &quot;<a href=&quot;https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Alternate_Identities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Alternate Identities</a>.&quot;</p><p>Tldr; a character (survivor or a hunter) whose already a playable character can be reintroduced as a whole new playable unit with a completely different kit and playstyle from their original counterpart. The selling point is that this was multi-factional. Norton, Orpheus, Joker, Luchino, Alice, and Mike... and the like have alternate identities in all different factions. In the future, there's always going to be more of these alternate identities for as long as Identity V's servers keep running.</p><p>There was a split in the community on whether or not this mechanic was being handled to its potential. In 2024, 3 out of 6 of the characters with confirmed alternate identities only had been presented in dramatic sequences as their hunter forms when everyone's explicitly doped up on Orpheus's drugs.</p></div><br><h4>&rarr; Ashes of Memory II Changed The System</h4><div><p>... For the worst. This &quot;The monsters were actually hallucinations&quot; thing felt lazy on Netease's end. I could've accepted this reveal once in AOM I, but twice is pushing it.</p><p>To better gauge the significance of this system, Identity V announces around 6 new characters a year, though the frequency of upcoming character content has slowed down with time. With this new system in order, some SNS character introductions double as an identity switch, and their ingame debuts have all been followed with a fully-animated, cutscene-packed event for their respective lore. Players wait maybe a year or two for established lore to get expanded on. That's fine, that's what we signed up for.</p><p>What disappointed me was how we didn't get to see much of the internal politics and relationships that occured during or before &quot;AOM II&quot;. It was one of the weaker storyline updates to follow Norton's identity switch (&quot;Fool's Gold&quot;). From Alice's perspective we were able to detect an air of tense familiarity with all the guests in her game, but that was something we already knew from the letters. The development between <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Time_of_Reunion' target='_blank'>Time of Reunion</a> and &quot;Ashes of Memory I&quot; felt delayed by the bloat of Ashes of Memory II. The cherry on top? &quot;The monsters were actually hallucinations.&quot;</p><p>Hullabaloo's storyline event exceled where TOR/AOM didn't while also having a theme of hallucinated monsters, so I do have some hope for this system's future. Again, TOR/AOM was the very last recorded game that occured at Oletus, so the developers have incentive to milk the AOM cast's likeness without having much to say when they've demonstrated decent writing &amp; pacing before. It's not completely devoid of new information &mdash; we learned the origin of Mary's ghost, Melly &amp; Frederick's grounds to attend the manor game, and the Norton fans got a stupid bread scene that IDV Tw*tter couldn't put down. It's very likely that when TOR/AOM's storyline wraps up, it'll all be as satisfying as Hullabaloo's sequence.</p><p>One of Identity V's strongest points is its ambiguity and openendedness for the same reasons we might enjoy mythology or cryptic beasts. The franchise <b>does</b> take advantage of this using Lovecraftian frameworks, its why they're able to milk their characters every year so that they don't have to write the story in one sitting.</p><p>When thinking why the two player factions exist (outside of their roots to DBD's format), it makes you think about why some hunters earned their fate as hunters, and what separates them from the survivors who themselves committed many if not more moral injuries than the hunters. I was pretty disappointed that with the alternate identity system, the developers started its early order by chalking it up to &quot;hallucinations&quot; when they've already struck gold by retaining the mystery of what hunters are.</p><p>This is why Luchino is the alternate identity system's saving grace by tapping into the ambiguity of Identity V.</p></div><br><h4>&rarr; The Vague Nature of Luchino&quot;</h4><div><p>Considering his plot, nobody really knows whether or not we are interpreting Reptilian Luchino as we see it, or if we can really chalk it up to just drugs. Luchino's survivor form (professor) is visibly growing scales and his arms bleed when they fall off. As far as we know, Professor is real and in front of us, the point of reference. Evil Reptilian is who we want to be.</p><p>Apparently Professor Luchino was confirmed 30 in the Character Relations tab while Reptilian Luchino was confirmed 35 in the official artbook (and later changed to have an undecided age). Since he was one of the few characters to participated in more than one manor game, time would have passed during his recorded appearances which offers the feasible notion for Luchino to have actually transformed to the final stage of &quot;full reptile&quot; between these games. The trick here, is that they don't lift the curtain and explain who Evil Reptilian is to the rest of the cast.</p><p>I'd prefer the hunter form dynamics to be obscured permanently in the narrative rather than every game having been revealed as a drug plot back to back. I find this type of mystery attractive.</p></div><br><center><a href='#' onclick='selectLink(`headcanonsList`)'><img src='images/hunt_luchino_40x40.gif' alt='Click me to proceed'></a></center>";

The casting department cooked with this one.</li></ul><li>Pre-transformation Luchino has both lobes pierced, but can no longer wear ear jewelry post-transformation. He does pierce his own tongue sheath though.</li><li>Since Luchino was only reported missing, he's probably still alive and squatting in the non-occupied cabin in Darkwoods that Bane Perez used to rest in.</li><ul><li>This is my way of shoehorning him into AOM and making Luchino x Norton work. I like to think that after Norton retreats from his assassination attempt in Darkwoods, he stays in hiding at the hunting cabin and meets Luchino there, the legend'd reptilian of Britain.</li><li>Yidhra also appears at the bonfire if you chair 3 survivors, so this conveniently (but barely) ties Luchino into this map for me.</li></ul><li>Given that Luchino has the quadratojugal bone that allows reptiles, birds, and amphibians to dislocate their jaws, Luchino's teeth are exclusively for gripping and killing. He also can't chew given that he lost his molars, and instead swallows bodies whole.</li><ul><li>The range of large animals he can swallow whole are pigs, goats, and deers.</li><li>Luchino has trouble breathing while jumping around. When reaching the stage where his neck had transformed into a thicker trunk, he experimented a lot with the limits of what he can swallow resulting in laryngeal neuropathy. After jumping, he pants in <a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/shorts/vCdFTjDBDho?si=l8luvSFQD-dTHGEa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>the same way horses with this condition do</a>.

Mid-transformation, all the bits recede internally and it's not that different from a hairless marsupial's cloaca. I imagine your junk growing scales and turning inside out is terrifying to see though.</li><li>In his early-stage transformations, he develops a microscale film all over his body. They're so small that you can't see the individual scutes and too thin and soft to have yet developed his infamous teal color, but it gives him a glossy look.</li><ul><li>As this film becomes thicker towards the final stage of his metamorphosis, shedding becomes more painful. Like tearing a 2mm deep scab off your entire body. It's a bloody process, but natural.</li></ul><li>In the mid-late stages of his metamorphosis, his human hair completely sheds and is gradually replaced with a scalp of nanoscale pillars, similar to the hairs on a gecko's feet.</li></ul></div><br><center><a href='#' onclick='selectLink(`otherTestimonies`)'><img src='images/hunt_luchino_40x40.gif' alt='Click me to proceed'></a></center>";

These very foundations create a parallel in how Norton and Luchino both understand themselves when met with the transcendent &amp; grotesque creatures that they cross roads with (these trascendent &amp; grotesque creatures both being Lovecraftian entities).</p><p>Beyond these similar upcomings, their different approaches and desires make them somewhat compatible if hypothetically to meet.</p></div><br><h4>&rarr; Ties In Lovecraft</h4><div><p>Luchino's tale is somewhat of a transhumanist one. The specimen his coworker gives him comes from a metaphysical force, <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Dream_Witch' target='_blank'>Yidhra</a>, one of the cryptic beasts I was referring to in &quot;Themes of Ambiguity&quot; and shares the name of another <a href='https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Yidhra'>Yidhra</a>. While not directly involved with the manor, she's recorded to transform and enslave men and women into followers and her goals are not stressed in lore as she's more of a &quot;high stakes pest&quot; than an actual Oletus participant or person. Not much is known about the process of Yidhra's metamorphosis.</p><p>Luchino doesn't seem to be fully under her influence, nor does he look like how the rest of her followers do besides having scales. When he does write about his insanity, it's reads like a simple side effect of turning unhuman &mdash; post-human. I read this as an implication he was marked by Yidhra and insanity is one of the stages of transforming into her follower, before he disappeared off the face of Earth.</p><p>Luchino writes about having came to terms with his human ignorance knowing that he won't ever understand &quot;all the answers&quot; and gives up his search for the &quot;Point B&quot; of his experiments. Instead, he pursues pleasure in his new body.</p><p>Norton also has history with another <a href='https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Glaaki' target='_blank'>otherworldly force</a>. The way Norton handles coming into contact with a supernatural entity is much different from Luchino's approach. He takes advantage of his curse to change his chances of freedom despite the debt that follows.</p><p>Between a man who spent his life in observation and a man who has never had family or friends to humor his problems, I think they'd have a longerterm friendship more easily with each other than anyone else in the manor. Despite being introverted and self-sustaining, they love to learn. At the very least, they'd initiate something friendly of first impressions. They have a lot to learn about each other's fields of work as they both envy the fruit of knowledge and that need to learn would keep their bond fresh for years.</p><p>I can imagine them having a late-night whiskey next to a banker's lamp. The night tells the time Norton found pockets of a rare type of salt after a cave flood and Luchino tells his field travels in India. When Luchino asks Norton if he's ever traveled overseas, Norton tells him he's never made it out of Britain outside of when he was contracted to another site on the margin. Maybe Luchino would encourage him to apply to the sciences. You can't see the stars from under the tunnels your entire life after all.</p><p>There's also just something romantic about two servants of two unrelated greater forces finding comfort in each other. It makes you wonder what'd they'd do to help each other escape their godly abductors, or how they'd feel if they failed to help at all. What if they both watched each other become something else over time; would Norton find solidarity in his soulmate's firm reptilian skin? Would Luchino mourn Norton succumbing to <a href='https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Servant_of_Glaaki' target='_blank'>the green decay</a>? Does Norton envy the academic life Luchino was gifted? There's a lot of potential exploration.</p></div><br><h4>&rarr; Community Reception</h4><div><p>As if Luchino fans weren't rare enough, any media of LuchiNort is even rarer (even though its one of the original pairings.) In the earlier seasons, it was somewhat controversial to romantically pair hunters with survivors because of their roles ingame. With the introduction to &quot;alternate identities,&quot; people are a lot more accepting of these types of dynamics since a hunter can also be a survivor at the same time. Excuses for why they appear as hunters differ, be it through hallucinogens or actual metaphysical demons.</p><p>I've made a lot of friends through our enjoyment of this pairing, and I'm still creating art of them today. I'm glad they support me back.</p></div><h4>&rarr; Explore Luchino x Norton Artists</h4><div><p>A list of LuchiNort artists and contributors I like.
