      <h3>General Commission Information</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>You will be paying for my time, not the exclusivity of the art. After payment you will be the image's new owner, but I post finished commissioned works on my SNS to keep art a thriving hobby of mine.</li>
        <li>Do not print my work for profit. Commissioners may use their purchases for personal objects like t-shirts and stickers so long as it's not commercial.</li>
        <li>Terms of service can change at any time. Occupied slots will be informed of any new terms.</li>
        <li>All monetary payments (USD) are taken through Ko-fi unless otherwise specified. I'm refusing to use Paypal for the time being.</li>
        <li>TAT for each piece will vary from a week to months, so name deadlines upon discussion.</li>
        <li>Negotiate prices if you need to. Final price must be agreeable between both parties</li>
        <li>High degree violations (listed below) will put you on a public blacklist.</li>
     </ol>

     <h3>Request Guidelines</h3>
     <p>* All skintones and gender identities are welcome.</p>
     <p><normal style="color:green;">I specialize in</normal> character design, humanoids, and mammal anthros/regular animals. My best compositions are logo, sticker, or charm designs.</p>
     <p><normal style="color:#a39621;">I sometimes make exceptions for</normal> vehicles/machinery, musician/band fanart, other types of anthropomorphics, slapstick violence, and light raunchy subjects. I can also make a mean CD cover.</p>
     <p><normal style="color:red;">I decline</normal> reference sheets, real people, and anything pornographic, bloody, or NSFW in that nature. <b>asking for any depictions of child abuse result in a blacklist position</b>.</p>
     <hr>
     <h3>Before you order...</h3>
     <ol>
       <li>I take full payments after sketch/composition stage.</li>
       <li>If after specified deadline I don't respond, please be patient with me and just keep asking. I make efforts to reply and I manage multiple E-mail inboxes.</li>
       <li>I am a character artist! Please play into my strengths.</li>
       <li>Have a reference sheet or image at the ready. I'm not doing character design from scratch.</li>
       <li>It helps to tell me what you are using the design or art for during the composition stage.</li>
     </ol>
     <hr>
     <h3>Requesting Form</h3>
     <p>Send a request to commission me <a href="mailto:0ekekddddd@protonmail.com">by e-mail</a>.</p>
     <hr>
     <h3>Short Artist FAQ</h3>
       <p><b>What tools?</b> Clip Studio Paint and Gimp. Wacom Tablet, DTZ-1200W LCD.</p>
       <p><b>Can I use your existing artwork as a profile picture or graphic?</b> <br>Fanarts, yes. Some of my original artworks are commissioned pieces, so I'd advise against using those if you haven't asked the image owners for their permissions.</p>
