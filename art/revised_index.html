    <h2>commission guidelines</h2>
    <h3>General Commission Information</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Every commission is defined by the time it takes to work on a request, not the exclusivity of the artwork. Every commission is an explicit exchange of image ownership.</li>
        <li>I post WIP screencaps and finished works on my SNS. Private commissions will cost extra as I depend on my artwork to advertise my business.</li>
        <li>Do not print my work for profit unless permitted. Commissioners may use their purchases for personal objects like t-shirts and stickers so long as it's not commercial.</li>
        <li>Terms of service can change at any time. Slot holders will be informed of new terms presented at time of occupation.</li>
        <li>All payments (USD) are taken through Ko-fi unless otherwise specified.</li>
        <li>TAT for each piece will vary from a week to months, so name deadlines upon discussion.</li>
        <li>I accept price negotiations.</li>
     </ol>
     <hr>
     <h3>Request Guidelines</h3>
     <p>* All skintones and gender identities are welcome.</p>
     <p><normal style="color:green;">I specialize in</normal> character design, humanoids, and mammal anthros/regular animals. My best compositions are logo, sticker, or charm designs.</p>
     <p><normal style="color:#a39621;">I sometimes make exceptions for</normal> vehicles/machinery, and other types of anthropomorphics. I also offer both muted NSFW with a specialty in pin-up style artwork and some other types of pornography, but please don't order before e-mailing me privately about details.</p>
     <p><normal style="color:red;">I decline</normal> reference sheets and real people. <b>Asking for any depictions of underage abuse result in a blacklist position</b>. I may reject a commission without explanation.</p>
     <hr>
     <h3>Before you order...</h3>
     <ol>
       <li>I am a character artist! Please play into my strengths.</li>
       <li>Have a reference sheet or image at the ready.</li>
       <li>It helps to tell me what you are using the design or art for during the composition stage.</li>
     </ol>
     <hr>
     <h3>Payments &amp; Refunds</h3>
     <p>Payment upfront, or talk to me about a two payment arrangement. For two-payments, 50% upfront and 50% after delivery.</p>
     <p>Refunds are not always guaranteed, and I definitely won't refund after the rendering process (after composition stage) has been started.</p>
     <hr>
     <h3>Requesting Form and Contact</h3>
     <p>Send a request to commission me <a href="mailto:0ekekddddd@protonmail.com">by e-mail</a>.</p>
     <hr>
     <h3>Short Artist FAQ</h3>
       <p><b>What tools?</b> Clip Studio Paint and Gimp. Wacom Tablet, DTZ-1200W LCD.</p>
       <p><b>Can I use your existing artwork as a profile picture or graphic?</b> <br>Fanarts, yes. Some of my original artworks are commissioned pieces, so I'd advise against using those if you haven't asked the image owners for their permissions.</p>
