      <description><![CDATA[Good afternoon, I am a freelance artist/graphic designer&nbsp;with a little experience in the&nbsp;merchandising&nbsp;scene. I've hoisted the beams for a new blog in regards to future product announcements as well as the convenience of my followers keeping track of the next charm, next print, next piece.
<p>I design and manufacture from scratch a majority of the stuff I sell like stickers, prints, and cosplay props. I also make a&nbsp;side living&nbsp;doing web design, UI, and illustration.</p>
<p>Two years ago, my social media presence was null so chances are most of my original viewers are here for my website development projects and non-artistic creations. I've secretly been maintaining a sizeable SNS following and have been&nbsp;networking my local art community, hence the "sleek" direction my site has taken. My indie web philosophies have never changed though; I just brought my healthy online habits to the wastelands. In the end, I still find refuge in what's really mine: my&nbsp;homepage and my local family.</p>
<p>Of course, for the luddites, I've tailored an RSS feed completely for you. By subscribing to this feed, you may get early updates about my newest merch designs, when the Ko-fi store page has a new item, or when I open preorders.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking in.</p>]]></description>
