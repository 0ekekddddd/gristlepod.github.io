      <title>2025.03.21 // New Kokichi Fanstock</title>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 20:43:10 -0500</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I finally invested in a can badge puncher thanks to supporter funds, and I'm thrilled to create some badge-exclusive designs. For now, some of my previous art will also be available as badges and I'm taking suggestions (e-mail). New can badges, new stickers, and preorders for acrylic charms are live for my new Kokichi bootlegs @ Ko-fi.</p><center><img style="max-width: 400px; width: 80%" src="https://gristlepod.github.io/rss/thumbnails/kokichibomb_thumbnail.png"></center>]]></description>

      <title>2025.03.04 // Store Coming Together.  Sketch Terms Updated</title>
      <pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 15:06:53 -0600</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Following the last update the Ko-fi store is back online and I've sorted things out with moderation. Shop was looking a little chaotic so I've relocated all prints into one list and it should be much easier to navigate.</p>
<p>I've been getting a lot more sketch requests lately and I have to thank everyone for the recent attention. Being my most popular service I decided to update its terms to neighbor plans for the shop's future, meaning I won't be doing colored sketches anymore or it could cut time in this next project; I'm going to begin taking my art out of the studio to sell at conventions local to me.</p>
<p>I'm pretty excited as I've been massproducing stock as well as designing both new fanmerch and personal merch. I encourage those new to the website to subscribe to my RSS if you're in the US and interested in IDV merch. I will start posting line-ups in upcoming logs.</p>
<p>I'm briefly closing commissions while I focus on the new rove into vending, but they'll be back when I'm not as busy.</p>]]></description>

      <title>2025.02.21 //  Cosplay Prop Commissions @ Etsy</title>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:14:42 -0600</pubDate>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've opened a storepage over at Etsy to pay off some bills. I've been doing propwork for a few years now (both foamsmithing and recently 3d printing), and I've gotten good feedback about my modeling work prior. If any Identity V fans are missing a Norton compass or need a kukri blade to complete their Luchino or Naib cosplay, visit my page @ <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PrintedByAPod">PrintedByAPod</a>. More designs coming soon.</p><p>On another note, the Ko-fi page may be down due to some misunderstandings with the moderation over on the site. I already submitted an appeal, but it shouldn't break anyone's ability to commission me. As always, my contact is 0ekekddddd@protonmail.com for slots. Thanks for reading.</p>]]></description>
