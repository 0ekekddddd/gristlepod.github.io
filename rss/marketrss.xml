      <description><![CDATA[Two years ago, my social media presence was null so chances are most of my original viewers are here for my website development projects and non-artistic creations. I've secretly been maintaining a sizeable SNS following and have been&nbsp;networking my local art community, hence the "sleek" direction my site has taken. My indie web philosophies have never changed though; I just brought my healthy online habits to the wastelands. In the end, I still find refuge in what's really mine: my&nbsp;homepage and my local family.
<p>I've hoisted the beams for a new blog in regards to future product announcements as well as the convenience of my followers. Of course, for the luddites, I've tailored an RSS feed completely for you. By subscribing to this feed, you may get early updates about my newest merch designs, when the Ko-fi store page has a new item, or when I open preorders.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking in.</p>]]></description>
