      <title>Cosplay Prop Commissions @ Etsy</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've opened a storepage over at Etsy to pay off some bills. I've been doing propwork for a few years now (both foamsmithing and recently 3d printing), and I've gotten good feedback about my modeling work prior. If any Identity V fans are missing a Norton compass or need a kukri blade to complete their Luchino or Naib cosplay, visit my page @ <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PrintedByAPod">PrintedByAPod</a>. More designs coming soon.</p><p>On another note, the Ko-fi page may be down due to some misunderstandings with the moderation over on the site. I already submitted an appeal, but it shouldn't break anyone's ability to commission me. As always, my contact is 0ekekddddd@protonmail.com for slots. Thanks for reading.</p>]]></description>
